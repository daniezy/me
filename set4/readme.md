TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
Set four used local file paths to draw out data from websites, definitely the most challenging exercise. The theory was the hardest to understand and I still need to develop my skills on importing requests from websites (using url’s, ‘r’, and ID). I still don’t understand a lot of the code surrounding lists and how they extract data however the code worked with some help from peers. Overall the week expanded my knowledge on what code could do and how it reaches out to external websites.
