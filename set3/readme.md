TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
The catching errors set three exercises uses the debugging tool to test set lines of code. Using loops, and the return function the exercise asks you to return a set variable each getting more difficult. Here I leaned about the ‘return’ function being able to repeat code until a certain variable is given. The Super_Asker combined all exercises in set 2, which overall wasn’t too complicated however the advanced guessing game took the longest and is what I struggled, needing help for.
