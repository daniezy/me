TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

excerise 2 prints 'MC hammer',

This week was learning about constructing lists/strings, also the different ways you can construct them. Strings can be combined both with numbers while being returned by Booleans, they can also be added onto with ‘+’, lists on the other hand make loops from already defined variables (range, append) allowing you to return a pattern. I struggled with exercises 4-7 because they used more increate code combining dictionaries, different formatting and especially the last exercise with math’s. Although I understand the theory and how to construct basic lists.
